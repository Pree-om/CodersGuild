🚀 Welcome to the SOA Coders’ Guild!

Where coders level up, power up & glow up ✨💻

</div>

⚡ The Ultimate Coding Ecosystem

We’ve merged the forces of Codex, CN10XoC, and GFG Campus Body ITER to build the ultimate learn → practice → test power loop. Backed by mentors, industry experts, and a community ready for some serious grind.

💥 What’s inside the Guild?

🗓️ Daily coding drills: Consistency is key. We code every day.

🥷 Weekend ninja clinics: Deep dives into advanced concepts and algorithms.

⚔️ Ranked battles: Test your skills in high-stakes contests (a.k.a. tests 👀).

🦸‍♂️ The Ultimate Goal: DSA gains, coding speed boosts & placement superpowers.

🧠 About This Repository (Mentor's Hub)

Hey there! 👋 I am a Mentor at the SOA Coders' Guild.

This repository is my personal code vault and teaching hub. I don't just push code here; I push LOGIC. If you are stuck on a drill, bombed a ranked battle, or just can't wrap your head around a specific algorithmic approach, this is your sanctuary. For every piece of code you find here, you'll find a detailed breakdown of the why and how behind it.

🛠️ How to Use This Repo

To get the most out of these resources, don't just copy-paste! Follow the Mentor's Mandate:

Try it yourself first: Give the problem your best shot. Break it. Fail. Try again.

Read the LOGIC: Open my solution file and read the commented logic/approach before looking at the code.

Code it blindly: Once you understand the approach, go back to your editor and write it yourself.

Compare & Optimize: Check your code against mine. Did you miss an edge case? Is there a faster way?

🤝 Let's Connect & Grow

Got questions about a specific solution? Found a bug in my code? (Hey, even mentors make typos!).

Ping me in the Guild's Discord/WhatsApp group.

Catch me during the Weekend Ninja Clinics!
